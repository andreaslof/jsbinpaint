Herp derp derp, info soon to come!

jsbinpaint should:
- Convert a string to an md5/sha-1 hash
- Take said hash and base2-encode it
- Divide the base2-encoded string into groups of four (1101,1011 etc)
- Take those values and use them as a co-ordinate system for painting with canvas
- The values represent boolean-statements of the direction where it should move (x,y)
